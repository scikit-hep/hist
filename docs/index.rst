Welcome to Hist's documentation!
================================


Introduction
------------

`Hist <https://github.com/scikit-hep/hist>`_ is a powerful Histogramming tool for analysis based on `boost-histogram <https://boost-histogram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ (the Python binding of the Histogram library in Boost). It is a friendly analysis-focused project that uses `boost-histogram <https://boost-histogram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ as a backend to do the work, but provides plotting tools, shortcuts, and new ideas.

To get an idea of creating histograms in Hist looks like, you can take a look at the :doc:`Examples <examples/index>`.
